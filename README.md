- Responsive design


## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Data Fetching**: Axios
- **Charting Library**: Recharts
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed on your system.
   - You can verify the installation by running:
     
     node -v
     npm -v
     

### Steps to Set Up the Application Locally 
1. Create a new React application using the following command:
   npx create-react-app weather-app


2. Navigate into the application directory:
cd weather-app


3. Install the required dependencies:
npm install axios recharts



4. Replace the contents of src/App.js with the application code provided in this repository.
Create an .env file in the root of your project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

API_KEY=your_api_key_here
URL= WEATHER_API_URL



5. Start the development server:
npm start


## API Credentials 
URL= https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}

API KEY=2947d02539dba6a9b9a01db597ab60b4




## Using Github Clone 

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app


2.  Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the required packages:
    npm install



3.  Start the Application: Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server:
    npm start



This will launch the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.







## Example Usage Scenario

Use Case: If you want to monitor the weather in Delhi or any city and receive alerts when the temperature goes above 35Â°C:
Select Delhi from the city dropdown.
Set the temperature threshold to 35.
Monitor the alert message to see if the current temperature exceeds your set threshold.
